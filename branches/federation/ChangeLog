        * dds/InfoRepo/Federator.idl:
	
	  Updated interface and data definitions to reflect latest review
	  results.  This includes addition of the 'discover_federation'
	  method.  It also includes the specification of the UpdateType
	  and addition of the 'owner' and 'action' members to the update
	  data structures.

        * dds/DCPS/DomainParticipantFactoryImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/simpleTCP/SimpleTcpConnection.cpp:
        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfo_i.cpp:
        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPS_Utils.h:

          These files differed from the r1260 trunk version in whitespace
          only.  Removed these differences.

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

          This was not synchronized with the r1260 trunk version.  Now it
          is identical with it.  The change was to make the
          -DCPSTransportDebugLevel option name correct.
