A test for TRANSIENT_LOCAL_DURABILITY_QOS implementation. 
The datawriter with the TRANSIENT_LOCAL_DURABILITY_QOS durability should
resend the sending and sent samples to the newly associated datareaders.

This test is also used to test the fix for a deadlock situation. The deadlock
happens between fully_associated() thread and write()/register() thread when 
using TRANSIENT_LOCAL_DURABILITY_QOS. The fully_associated() thread calls the
PublisherImpl::data_available() function which acquires the publisher lock and 
then the writer container lock while the write()/register() thread acquires 
writer container lock and then the publisher lock. To fix the lock reverse order
problem, the fully_associated() was changed to acquire the writer container 
lock before calling PublisherImpl::data_available().

To simulate the deadlock test scenario, the PublisherImpl::data_availabe() 
need be modified to have sleep for 2 seconds before send(list) if 
resend is true. Without the fix, a deadlock happened in this test.
With the fix, the test should pass.
