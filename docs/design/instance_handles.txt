As a part of DDS 1.2 specification compliance (formal/07-01-01)
InstanceHandle_t requires refactoring. Currently, instance handles are either
derived from an associated RepoId assigned by the DCPSInfoRepo or generated
as a sequence.  Due to the increased scope and wider use presented in the
updated specification, a new generation scheme is required.

Instance handles should be divided into two categories:
- Entity instance handles
- Data instance handles

Entity instance handles are assigned to both local and remote entities
by the DomainParticipantImpl.  At the time an entity instance handle is
created, a corresonding RepoId must be available and associated for remote
entities.  These RepoIds are used when calling the DCPSInfoRepo for the
various ignore_* operations.  When a new entity instance handle is created,
the DomainParticipantImpl should verify that the given RepoId has not already
been associated.  If it has, the previously assigned instance handle should
be used.  If it has not, a new instance handle should be generated and
associated with the given RepoId in a map managed by the DomainParticipantImpl.
If a local entity does not have a corresponding RepoId, then the GUID_UNKNOWN
constant will be inserted.  The publication_handle in the SampleInfo structure
must have an entity instance handle which corresonds to the publication RepoId 
when a sample is received.

Entity instance handles should have their state periodically purged when
entities are either deleted or disassociated.  

Data instance handles are scoped to the associated DataReaderImpl or
DataWriterImpl.  These instance handles are not intended to be mixed
with entity instance handles.  The sole exception to this rule is when a
Builtin Topic is used to lookup an entity which is then passed to one of the
ignore_* operations on the DomainParticipant (see below).

Unlike entity instance handles, data instance handles do not maintain any
additional state which need purging.

InstanceHandle_t:
0...2...........8...............16.............24...............32
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|type(4)|                     sequence(28)                      |
+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+

InstanceHandleType Enumeration:
0x00   TYPE_UNKNOWN
0x01   TYPE_PARTICIPANT
0x02   TYPE_TOPIC
0x03   TYPE_SUBSCRIBER
0x04   TYPE_PUBLISHER
0x05   TYPE_DATAREADER
0x06   TYPE_DATAWRITER
0x0F   TYPE_DATA

The InstanceHandle_t type is currently a typedef to a CORBA long in
DdsDcpsInfrastructure.idl (this will not change).  The lower 4 bits of the
overall 32-bit value contains a type field (InstanceHandleType) that indicates
the type of handle.  The upper 28 bits are a sequence which allows for up to
268,435,456 instance handles be assigned per type.

The InstanceHandleType field allows the DomainParticipantImpl to perform
additional error checking in the various ignore_* operations.  If a data
instance handle is passed to an ignore operation, it is assumed that it 
corresponds to an entity referenced by a Builtin Topic.  The RepoId will
then be generated from the BuiltinTopicKey_t for that instance and used.

It should be noted that if Builtin Topics are disabled, the ignore_* operations
will only function for known entities (both local and remote).

The DCPSInfoRepo must have all references to InstanceHandle_t removed.  As the
scope and responsibility for generating these values has now shifted to
DomainParticipantImpl, it is no longer neccessary (or correct) for the
DCPSInfoRepo to be aware of an assigned instance handle.
