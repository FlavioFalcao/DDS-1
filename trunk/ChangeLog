        * dds/idl/dds_visitor.h:
        * dds/idl/dds_visitor.cpp:

          Added a check for use of anonymous sequence or array fields in
          unions or structs.  These anonymous types are deprecated in OMG IDL
          and not supported at all with opendds_idl.  Use a typedef instead.

          Fixed a TAO version check off-by-one error.
