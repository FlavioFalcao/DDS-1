        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/ReliableSession.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/ReliableSession.cpp:

          Fixed deadlock caused by shared mutex between starting and
          acknowledgement critical sections.

        * performance-tests/Bench/tests/latency/p1-16000.ini:

          Update to use new datamodel.  Thanks to Don Busch for finding
          this.

        * dds/DCPS/WriteDataContainer.cpp:

          Fixed a bug in obtain_buffer() when max_blocking_time is 0 or very small
          period. The condition makes the write() not wait for old sample releasing.
          In this case, the TIMEOUT error code should be returned.

        * dds/DCPS/DataWriterImpl.cpp:

          Turned off the error logging as obtain_buffer() returns TIMEOUT error code.

        * tests/DCPS/FooTest5/InstanceDataMap.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/FooTest5/Writer.cpp:
        * tests/DCPS/FooTest5/run_test.pl:

          - Adjusted result verify.
          - Log timeout error return from write() only if DCPS_debug_level > 0.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ThreadSynchStrategy.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ThreadSynchStrategy_rch.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportConfiguration.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportConfiguration.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportConfiguration.cpp:

          Added support for optionally specifying a ThreadSynchStrategy
          implementation at construction-time (submitted by Don Busch).

        * dds/DCPS/transport/udp/UdpConfiguration.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/multicast/MulticastConfiguration.cpp:

          Updated UDP-based transports to use a NullSynchStrategy by
          default; this prevents spurious threads from being spawned
          for each created DataLink (submitted by Don Busch).

        * dds/DCPS/transport/udp/UdpTransport.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/udp/UdpTransport.cpp:

          Updated support for endpoint addressing; DataLinks are created
          per unique endpoint rather than RepoId (submitted by Don Busch).
