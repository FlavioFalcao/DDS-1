        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/run_test:

          Explicitly search the environment PATH variable for the
          repository and test commands to execute.

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/run_test:

          Prepend the script directory to the command search path and
          then use that path to find commands.  This allows installations
          other than the 'mkpkg' ones to work as well.

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/run_test:

          Previous debug file specification change is now extended to the
          testprocess commands as well.

        * performance-tests/Bench/tests/latency/latency.mm:

          Adding and updating documentation.

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/run_test:

          Allow debug file to be specified in the absence of a debug
          level.  This allows the verbose test output to reach a logfile
          instead of the standard output.

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/run_test:

          Do not remove the repo.ior file unless we are going to start a
          repository process.
          Updated POD.

        * performance-tests/Bench/doc/userguide.html:

          Updated documentation.

        * performance-tests/Bench/src/Publication.cpp:
        * performance-tests/Bench/src/Subscription.cpp:

          Added more detail to the transport creation/obtain processing
          to ensure that the transport type is available in the logfile.
