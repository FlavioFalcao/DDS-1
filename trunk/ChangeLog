        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/extract-latency.pl:

          Updated documentation to be correct after adding the Median and
          Median absolute deviation statistical data.

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/gen-latency-stats.pl:

          Updated generated GNUPlot statistical legend data to contain
          the Median and Median absolute deviation instead of the Mean
          and Standard Deviation.  This is part of the move towards use
          of robust statistics in the data reduction and visualization.

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/run_test:

          Updated the 'netstat' command arguments to provide all inet
          information instead of just active TCP connections.

        * performance-tests/Bench/tests/latency/run_test.pl:
        * performance-tests/Bench/tests/thru/run_test.pl:

          Adjusted running time handling.

Tue Apr 27 22:53:33 UTC 2010  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/run_test:

          Changed statistics command termination from SIGQUIT (which
          produces a core file) to SIGINT (which does not).

          Updated POD documentation.

        * performance-tests/Bench/doc/userguide.html:

          Updated documentation.

Tue Apr 27 18:39:41 UTC 2010  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/reduce-latency-data.pl:

          Simplified the MAD determination.  Added a Pearson 2 parameter
          estimation of skewness for investigative purposes.

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/run_test:

        * performance-tests/Bench/doc/userguide.html:

          Incorporated some more of Brian's comments.  Updated run_test
          man page with new statistics output filename decorator
          specification feature documentation.

        * performance-tests/Bench/src/Process.cpp:

          Extended signal handling to be a bit more robust.  Control can
          now fall out of the publication wait as well as allowing the
          subscription wait to be gracefully terminated as well.

          Added support to set TTL for multicast transport.

Sun Apr 26 00:35:23 UTC 2010  Trevor Fields  <fields_t@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/Bench/tests/thru/run_test.pl:

          Changed to add time to the run time of the client side to compensate
          for server side delay in starting repo.

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/plot-throughput-transports.gp:
        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/plot-throughput.gp:

          Removed plot-throughput.gp because all because graphs are made through
          the more specific plots.

        * performance-tests/Bench/doc/userguide.html:

          Updated information about changed files.

        * performance-tests/Bench/tests/latency/test_list.txt:
        * performance-tests/Bench/tests/thru/test_list.txt:

          Swapped the client and server for castor and pollux.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendBuffer.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportSendStrategy.cpp:

          - Made TransportSendBuffer clone the transport element and
            packet with its own MessageBlock and DataBlock cached
            allocators and heap allocation for the sample data.

          - Fixed a potential issue in TransportSendBuffer due to buffers_
            not mutex protected. The bug may cause invalid iterator(or
            corruption) while iterating sequence buffers for resending
            from reactor thread and the insert calls to release aged
            buffer due to capacity limit from another thread (e.g. write
            thread).

          - Changed TransportQueueElement::data_dropped and
            TransportQueueElement::data_delivered to have return value
            to indicate if the element is released. This would fix
            memory corruption due to access the release flag after
            TransportQueueElement is released.

          - Moved clone() from TransportReplacedElement to
            TransportQueueElement so the TransportRetainElement
            can use it.

          Added running of throughput tests and corrected directory names.

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/extract-latency.pl:

          gathering.

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/run_test:

          Factored the filtering closures out and made them selectable by

        * performance-tests/Bench/tests/latency/run_test.pl:
        * performance-tests/Bench/tests/thru/run_test.pl:

          Adjusted to have the run_test on the server side handle the repo.
          Running the repo as a separate run_test was leaving cases of the repo
          still running after terminating the run_test.

Mon Apr 19 19:19:09 UTC 2010  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/extract-throughput.pl:

          Adjusted to produce a single data file with the test and
          transport data partitioned into separate indices.

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/plot-density.gp:
        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/plot-quantiles.gp:

          Candidate plotting commands for Quantile and Kernel Density
          Estimation charts.  These currently assume specific file names
          and locations.

        * performance-tests/Bench/tests/thru/test-commands.txt:

          Updated to generate output files useful for the current
          throughput extraction script.

          Fixed bugs that TransportReplacedElement clones samples owned
          by DataWriter using the cached allocators from DataWriter.This
          causes SEGV when releasing TransportReplacedElement after
          DataWrite is deleted.

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/run_test:

          Allow debug file to be specified in the absence of a debug
          level.  This allows the verbose test output to reach a logfile
          instead of the standard output.

Tue Mar 30 22:39:41 UTC 2010  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/run_test:

        * performance-tests/Bench/src/Subscription.cpp:

          Added more detail to the transport creation/obtain processing
