The TAO DDS is an open-source C++ implementation of the Object
Management Group's specification ""Data Distribution Service for
Real-time Systems". TAO DDS is built on the ACE
(http://www.theaceorb.com/product/aboutace.html) abstraction layer to
provide platform portability. TAO DDS also leverages capabilities of
TAO (http://www.theaceorb.com/), such as its IDL compiler and as the
basis of the OpenDDS DCPS Information Repository (DCPSInfoRepo).
 
The primary development of TAO DDS was done by the ACE/TAO development
team at Object Computing, Incorporated (http://www.ociweb.com) in St
Louis and Phoenix. It is released under the same generous license
terms as ACE, TAO and MPC.

This directory structure contains TAO DDS 0.11.

Note that this release is considered beta quality software and
therefore some small interface changes may occur before version 1.0 is
released.

* Support

OCI strives to make TAO DDS as bug free as possible. If you encounter
any problems with this release please fill out the PROBLEM-REPORT-FORM
file found in this directory and send to support@ociweb.com.

If you desire responsive commerical support for OCI on any problems
you encounter, we strongly recommend that you set up an account before
you actually need help. There is no cost to establish a normal
account.  Support charges only apply to work actually delivered.
However, we do offer premium level accounts for customers with
specific support and enhancement needs, and there may be ongoing
charges for such premium service.  To set up a support account or to

sales@ociweb.com.

* Features

This release of TAO DDS is based on the DDS Specification
formal/04-12-02. It features the following transport protocols:

** TCP
** Unreliable and reliable multicast
** UDP

TAO DDS has been found to perform better than other similar TAO
services (notification and real-time event channel) by a factor of two
or three. The features offered by the RTEC and NS are similar to DDS,
but not identical, so carefully examine your use-cases before choosing
one service over another. Speed is not the only criterion.

Currently TAO DDS does not support the Data Local Reconstruction Layer
(DLRL) portion of the DDS specification. In addition, support for some
Quality of Service policies is not currently available in TAO DDS. See
the chapter Data Distribution Service that is part of the TAO
Developer's Guide for further information on TAO DDS compliance with
the DDS specification. This chapter is freely available as a PDF file
from the same location where TAO DDS can be downloaded. If you would
like have OCI add a features to TAO DDS please see the Support section
for contact information.

* Dependencies

** TAO

TAO DDS requires the use of TAO. This release of TAO DDS has been
tested against the versions of TAO given below. Note that the 1.xa
releases are from OCI and can be obtained from
http://www.theaceorb.com/. The DOC Group releases can be obtained from
http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/. For responsive support from OCI
it is recommended that the latest version of the OCI release of TAO
used for TAO DDS development and testing be used.

*** TAO 1.5a
*** A current snapshot of DOC Group's 1.5.x

** MPC

The Makefile, Project, and Workspace Creator (MPC) software is another
OCI developed open source tool and is used to target multiple build
systems from a single set of files. MPC is used for generating TAO DDS
build files such as GNU makefiles or Microsoft Visual Studio solution
files. You can obtain the latest version at
http://www.ociweb.com/products/mpc.
