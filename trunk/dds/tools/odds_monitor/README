System notes:

You will need to set the environment for the standard ACE+TAO+DDS
settings.  Additionally, the following needs to be set:

> export QTDIR=/usr

If you are using a distribution version of Qt (such as the libqt4-dev
package for the Debian and Ubuntu distributions), then you will need to
set the environment to use a non-relative include directory for the Qt4
files:

> export QT4_INCDIR=/usr/include/qt4
