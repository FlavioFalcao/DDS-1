  <h2>Populating the Model</h2>

  <p>After the selection of a new OpenDDS Diagram you will then be
  presented with an editor that consists of a canvas and a palette
  of "libraries" that can dragged onto the canvas. An example of
  this editor is shown in the following figure.</p><img alt=
  "Creating new OpenDDS diagram" src=
  "../../images/new_diagram_editor.png">

  <p>You can open a library that is on the canvas by first
  selecting it and then double-clicking on it or pressing the Enter
  key. You can verify it is selected when you see a thick border
  around the figure with re-sizing handles on it as shown
  below.</p><img alt="Selected library" src=
  "../../images/main_diagram_selected_lib.png">

  <p>When you open up a library there will be a new editor window
  in your editor window. See <a href=
  "../diagrams/moving_between_diagrams.html">Moving between
  Diagrams</a> for information on working with multiple diagram
  editors.</p>
