odds_monitor - instrumentation viewer application for OpenDDS.

This application provides a GUI view into instrumentation of the OpenDDS
service.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUICKSTART:
> export QTDIR=/usr
> mwc.pl -type gnuace -features qt4=1
> make qt4=1
> make qt4=1 depend

------------------------------------------------------------------------
ENVIRONMENT:
You will need to set the environment for the standard ACE+TAO+DDS
settings.  See $DDS_ROOT/INSTALL for more information on these.

The base directory for Qt needs to be located by the QTDIR variable:

  QTDIR=/usr

If your system locates the Qt4 include directories in a location other
than $QTDIR/include, then you can set the QT4_INCDIR variable to locate
the include directory:

  QT4_INCDIR=/usr/include/qt4

NOTE: The standard Ubuntu installation locates the include directory in
      /usr/include/qt4, which is not $QTDIR/include, so this definition is
      required on that system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
DIRECTORIES:

doc/
  -- Contains documentation related to this application.

images/
  -- Contains image resources used by this application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILES:

Monitor.ui
  -- Qt4 designer file specifying the UI for the application.

Monitor.qrc
  -- Resource specification file, managed by Qt4 designer.

Monitor.mpc
  -- MPC project file for the application.

*.{h,cpp}
  -- source code for application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code notes:

The GUI source code files are compiled by the Qt meta-object compiler and
have certain macros and other non-standard language constructs that are
parsed by that system.

This means that it is not recommended to run a style utility on the GUI
files, as the Qt specific elements may no longer be recognizable by the
Qt tools.

Currently the GUI files that should not be reformatted include:
  all generated files
  Monitor_main.cpp
  MonitorDataModel.{h,cpp}
  TreeNode.h
  Viewer.{h,cpp}

System notes:

You will need to set the environment for the standard ACE+TAO+DDS
settings.  Additionally, the following needs to be set:

> export QTDIR=/usr

If you are using a distribution version of Qt (such as the libqt4-dev
package for the Debian and Ubuntu distributions), then you will need to
set the environment to use a non-relative include directory for the Qt4
files:

> export QT4_INCDIR=/usr/include/qt4
