************************************************************************
Each of the source projects is an Eclipse project and can be imported
directly into a workspace.  Using the Subversive Subversion plugin,
the project can be checked out directly into your workspace.

If you check in from within Eclipse using the Subversive plugin, please
extract your subversion commit comments (from your checkin) using the
'svn2cl' command.  A typical command would use options as follows:

  shell> svn2cl -a -i -r <from>:<to> --linelen=78 -o ChangeLog-temp

Where <from> and <to> span the changesets that were checked in from
eclipse.  Then add this generated entry to the top of the ChangeLog (or
BranchChangeLog).

Generated Projects (partially in repository https://svn.dre.vanderbilt.edu/DOC/DDS):

  NOTE: The source of these projects are mostly generated from the
        org.eclipse.modeling.model/models/OpenDDS.genmodel code generation
        specification.  The MANIFEST, XML and properties files controlling
        the behavior of these plugins are retained in the subversion
        repository.  The non-tailored (generated) source files are not
        checked into the repository and need to be generated for use.

  org.opendds.modeling.model.edit   (generated from org.opendds.modeling.model/models/OpenDDS.genmodel)
    - edit support for the ecore metamodels and profile.

  org.opendds.modeling.model.editor (generated from org.opendds.modeling.model/models/OpenDDS.genmodel)
