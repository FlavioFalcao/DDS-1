<h2>Working with OpenDDS Models</h2>

<h3>The OpenDDS Model</h3>

The OpenDDS Model consists of "libraries" of possibly re-usable OpenDDS elements and optionally Packages that can contain these libraries.

<div id="note">
<p>Library in this context is different than the concept of C++ object file libraries used in OpenDDS. Even though you may be working
with different modeling libraries the generated code will target a single object file library.</p>
</div>

<h3>Creating a Model</h3>

<p>To create an OpenDDS SDK model, from the <a href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.newWizard")'><b>Eclipse File -&#62; New </a> -&#62; Other...</b> (Ctrl+N) menu item select OpenDDS Diagram under
the OpenDDS Models category as shown in the figure below.</p>

<p>The Create OpenDDS Diagram wizard when then prompt for the name of the diagram file and the name of the file containing
domain model itself. It is recommended that when specifying the model file name you use the default which has the same base
name as the diagram file.</p>

<div id="note">
<p>Many diagram-based modeling tools keep both the model and diagram elements in a single file. In the case of
the OpenDDS SDK these files are kept separate. This will readily allow for alternative representations of the model
that coexist with diagrams to be considered.</p>
</div>

<br>

<div id="caution">
<p>After selecting the name of the diagram file, make sure you select the Next button instead of Finish.
Under certain conditions the base portion of default name for the model file will not match the base portion
of the diagram file if this step is skipped.</p>
</div>

<h3>Populating the Model</h3>

<p>After the selection of a new OpenDDS Diagram you will then be presented with an editor that consists of a canvas and a palette of "libraries"
that can dragged onto the canvas. An example of this editor is shown in the following figure.</p>

<p>You can open a library that is on the canvas by first selecting it and then double-clicking on it. You can verify it is selected when
you see a thick border around the figure with re-sizing handles on it as shown below.</p>
