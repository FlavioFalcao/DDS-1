        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:

          Fixed a warning.

	Thu Jul  3 00:33:05 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/README:

          Updated the patch for reproduce and verify RT11348 fix.

	Thu Jul  3 00:28:51 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        Fixed a race condition described in RT11348. The commit
        at "Fri Jun 27 19:42:06 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>"
        broke some tests. This time the fix was fully tested.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:

          Added pub_map_releasing_ and sub_map_releasing_ to save the snapshot
          of associations in datalink at the time the link is declared for releasing
          resource due to connection problem. The DataLinkCleanupTask will remove the
          associations based on the snapshot. This would fix the problem that new
          associations are removed while removing the old associations due to a failed
          connection. The problem occurs when actual removal is performed with a delay
          after the datalink lost its connection.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkCleanupTask.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkCleanupTask.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.inl:

          Moved the datalink cleanup operations in DataLinkCleanupTask::execute to a
          new function (clear_associations()) in DataLink class and removed TransportImpl
          reference in DataLinkCleanupTask as it's not needed.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ReceiveListenerSet.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ReceiveListenerSet.inl:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ReceiveListenerSet.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ReceiveListenerSetMap.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/ReceiveListenerSetMap.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RepoIdSet.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RepoIdSet.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RepoIdSetMap.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/RepoIdSetMap.cpp:

          Added operator= and clear functions to support map copy and clear.

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/README:

          Added description of dl_clean test case to reproduce the bug and verify the fix.
          The dl_clean test can not be run in an automated nightly build since it requires
          a special patch to prove the fix.

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/run_test.pl:

          Added dl_clean test case.

	Wed Jul  2 19:36:12 UTC 2008  Adam Mitz  <mitza@ociweb.com>

        * DDS_TAO.mwc:

          TAO's Svc_Utils is now used by DDS.

        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/README:
        * tests/DCPS/Reconnect/run_test.pl:

          Rolled back the "Fri Jun 27 19:42:06 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>"
          changes as it broke some tests. Will fix RT11348 later.

	Mon Jun 30 17:30:08 UTC 2008  Chad Elliott  <elliott_c@ociweb.com>

        * MPC/config/dcps_ts_defaults.mpb:

        * tests/DCPS/ViewState/ViewState.mpc:
        * tests/DCPS/ZeroCopyRead/ZeroCopyRead.mpc:

          Fixed MPC files that were missing the *TypeSupportImpl.cpp file after
          yesterday's scripted changes.  A recent change to MPC itself will
          allow us to not have to specify "Source_Files" in most cases, but the
          dcps_ts.pl custom type is not yet taking advantage of this new MPC
          feature.

	Fri Jun 27 22:14:26 UTC 2008  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * examples/DCPS/IntroductionToOpenDDS/run_test.pl:

          Added Perl script to execute the example similar to the bat
          files.

	Fri Jun 27 19:42:06 UTC 2008  Yan Dai  <dai_y@ociweb.com>

        Fixed a race condition described in RT11348.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLink.cpp:

          Added pub_map_releasing_ and sub_map_releasing_ to save the snapshot
          of associations in datalink at the time the link is declared for releasing
          resource due to connection problem. The DataLinkCleanupTask will remove the
          associations based on the snapshot. This would fix race condition that the new
          associations added to the same link during the period from the datalink
          is declared for releasing to the removal is performed are removed.

        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkCleanupTask.h:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/DataLinkCleanupTask.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/transport/framework/TransportImpl.inl:

          new function (clear_associations()) in DataLink class and removed TransportImpl
          reference in DataLinkCleanupTask as it's not needed.

	Fri Jun 27 19:14:01 UTC 2008  Steve Totten  <totten_s@ociweb.com>

        * DevGuideExamples/DCPS/Messenger/run_test.pl:
          Corrected spelling of -DCPSTransportDebugLevel option.

        * DevGuideExamples/DCPS/Messenger/subscriber.cpp:
        * DevGuideExamples/DCPS/Messenger/publisher.cpp:
          Updated usage message to list all possible arguments
          for the -t (transport type) option.


Tue Jul 15 23:03:12 UTC 2008  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.cpp:

          Initialization now is performed during federation join
          operation.  Added binding in IORTable to 'Federator/1382379631'
          in addition to 'Federator'.  This allows the ability to
          federate within different domains (the numeric is decimal value
          for the default domain).

        * dds/InfoRepo/FederatorConfig.h:
        * dds/InfoRepo/FederatorConfig.inl:
        * dds/InfoRepo/FederatorConfig.cpp:

        * dds/InfoRepo/UpdateListener_T.cpp:
        * dds/InfoRepo/UpdateReceiver_T.cpp:

          Syntax corrections.

        * dds/InfoRepo/FederatorManagerImpl.h:
        * dds/InfoRepo/FederatorManagerImpl.cpp:

          Implemented 'join_federation' behavior.  Implemented
          publication and subscription initialization during the join
          processing.

Mon Jul 14 22:21:52 UTC 2008  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.mpc:

          Adjusted to new set of files.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfoRepo.cpp:

          Removed callback to previous version of interface.

        * dds/InfoRepo/Federator.idl:

          Updated to be closer to recent requirements discussions.

        * dds/InfoRepo/FederatorManagerImpl.cpp:
        * dds/InfoRepo/FederatorManagerImpl_updates.cpp:

        * dds/InfoRepo/UpdateListener_T.h:
        * dds/InfoRepo/UpdateListener_T.cpp:

          New version of listener for the update topics.

        * dds/InfoRepo/UpdateProcessor_T.h:
        * dds/InfoRepo/UpdateProcessor_T.cpp:

          Abstract interface for updates to be processed through.

        * dds/InfoRepo/UpdateReceiver_T.h:
        * dds/InfoRepo/UpdateReceiver_T.cpp:

          Thread(s) for processing updates.

        * dds/InfoRepo/FederatorSubscriptions.cpp:

          Removed these files.

        * dds/DCPS/PublisherImpl.cpp:
        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.h:
        * dds/DCPS/SubscriberImpl.cpp:

          Localized repository access.  This removes the known caching of
          the repository references, which can be problematic if the
          repository to call is changed after the cached reference is
          made.

Thu Jul 10 19:15:21 UTC 2008  Mike Martinez  <martinez_m@ociweb.com>

        * dds/InfoRepo/Federator.idl:

          Updated interface and data definitions to reflect latest review
          results.  This includes addition of the 'discover_federation'
          method.  It also includes the specification of the UpdateType
          and addition of the 'owner' and 'action' members to the update
          data structures.

        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPSInfo_i.cpp:
        * dds/InfoRepo/DCPS_Utils.h:

          These files differed from the r1260 trunk version in whitespace
          only.  Removed these differences.

        * dds/DCPS/Service_Participant.cpp:

          This was not synchronized with the r1260 trunk version.  Now it
          is identical with it.  The change was to make the
          -DCPSTransportDebugLevel option name correct.
