        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/run_test:

          Added script PID to system statistics output file.  This will
          allow statistics to be gathered in a loopback test without
          conflicts.
          Corrected a documentation issue.

        * performance-tests/Bench/tests/thru/p1-be-*.ini:

          Updated Topics to be BEST_EFFORT.  This was preventing
          associations on the return trip from being made.

        * java/idl2jni/codegen/idl2jni_visitor.h:
        * java/idl2jni/codegen/idl2jni_visitor.cpp:

          Updated ast_visitor interface for upcoming DOC x.7.7 release.

        * performance-tests/Bench/tools/mkpkg:

          Use correct configuration file source for package.

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/run_test:

          Correct a syntax error.

        * performance-tests/Bench/tools/mkpkg:

          Add the new througput test configuration files to the built
          package.  Added a note about versions on the transport library
          link establishment as well.

        * performance-tests/Bench/bin/run_test:

          Added new '-C' option to indicate that process and system
          statistics should be collected.  System statistics are gathered
          using a single 'vmstat' command during the test, while process
          statistics are gathered for each sub-process using a batch
          'top' command.  This is useful only on *nix derived platforms
          and so is restricted to them.

        * performance-tests/Bench/src/Publication.cpp:

          Hoisted sample stack allocation out of sending loop.  Invariant
          sample sizes will no longer result in byte sequence needing to
          be extended for each sample.

        * performance-tests/Bench/src/Subscription.cpp:

          Added count summary output regardless of statistics collection
          to remove a need to calculate statistics to count samples.

        * performance-tests/Bench/tests/latency/test-commands.txt:

          Added '.txt' extension for convenience.

        * performance-tests/Bench/tests/thru:

          Added new pre-configured test.  This includes 13 conditions
          covering the message size/ message rate space to send from
          76 Mibps (100Mbps) through 1907 Mibps (2500Mbps) of data
          through the test path.
